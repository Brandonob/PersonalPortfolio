I worked in retail as a Visual Merchandiser before being accepted into the Pursuit Fellowship program and becoming a coder. There I was able to work alongside like minded individuals whom shared one single goal, to secure their first job as a developer. I hope to combine my love for fashion, music, and coding to deliver a frictionless user experience.   ",
