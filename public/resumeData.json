    "bio": "I am an open minded and dedicated creative. While growing up I always enjoyed building and the obstacles that came with it, whether it was an art project or putting a desk together. Having this passion, I gravitated towards coding when I was accepted into college because it showed me a new way to build and be hands-on. After college, I searched for ways to stay active in and increase my knowledge of coding. I was accepted into the Pursuit Fellowship program where I experienced what it was like to build as a team. I am grateful to have worked alongside a diverse group of individuals whom shared many challenges and were able to learn from each other. I aspire to use my creativity alongside my great problem solving skills to deliver a frictionless user experience.",
